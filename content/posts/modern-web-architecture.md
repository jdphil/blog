# Modern Web Architecture: A 2024 Perspective

As web applications become more complex, choosing the right architecture is crucial. Let's explore modern approaches to web architecture.

## Current Architectural Patterns

### 1. Microservices
Benefits and considerations:
- Scalability per service
- Independent deployment
- Technology flexibility
- Complex orchestration

### 2. Jamstack
Modern static sites with:
- Pre-rendering
- CDN distribution
- API integration
- Serverless functions

### 3. Server Components
New paradigm offering:
- Reduced client bundle
- Better SEO
- Improved performance
- Enhanced security

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Design
- Atomic design principles
- Composition patterns
- State management
- Performance optimization

### Build Tools
Modern essentials:
- Vite/Turbopack
- Module bundling
- Code splitting
- Tree shaking

## Backend Considerations

### API Design
- REST vs GraphQL
- Type safety
- Documentation
- Version control

### Data Layer
- Database selection
- Caching strategies
- Data validation
- Migration patterns

## Performance Optimization

Key areas of focus:
- Core Web Vitals
- Lazy loading
- Image optimization
- Edge computing

## Security Considerations

Essential measures:
- Authentication patterns
- Authorization flows
- Data encryption
- CORS policies

## Future Trends

Watch for:
